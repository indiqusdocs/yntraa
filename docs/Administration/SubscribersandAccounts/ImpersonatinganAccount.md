# Impersonating an Account

Apiculus provides a means for service provider support teams to login to a customer account and impersonate the subscriber. This is a useful tool for providing instant/on-call support.

To impersonate an account, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the target account and enter its details view.
2. Click on the **IMPERSONATE** button at the top-left of the account details pane.![Impersonate](img/Impersonate.png)
3. A prompt will appear requesting your password. Enter the password associated with your administrator account (the one you are currently logged in with).![Impersonate](img/Impersonate2.png)
4. A one-time password (OTP) will be sent to the subscriber's primary email ID. The support personnel can obtain this OTP from the customer.

	This also acts as explicit consent from the customer for the support personnel to login into their account.

5. If SMS is enabled, the customer will receive the OTP on their registered mobile number as well.
6. A one-time session will be created for the support personnel, who can login using the customer's primary email ID and the OTP obtained as described above.
   
   :::note
	If the customer logs in while an impersonated session is active, the support personnel will be logged out and will need to generate and obtain the OTP again.
