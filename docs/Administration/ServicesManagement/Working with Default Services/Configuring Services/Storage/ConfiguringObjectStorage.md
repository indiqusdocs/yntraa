# Configuring Object Storage

In object storage, data is stored as discrete objects containing data, metadata, and a unique identifier. Apiculus delivers the service as an integration with **Cloudian HyperStore**. Admins can configure the Object storage from the **Services** section. To configure the **Object Storage** service, follow these steps:
1. Go to **Default Services** in the primary navigation menu.
2. Select **Object Storage** under the **Storage** section.
3. Enable the switch at the top, to make this service available as part of the default services. This will enable all associated sections.
4. Under the **Availability** section, select the **Availability Zones** where you want to offer the service. Then, click on **Save and Update**.
