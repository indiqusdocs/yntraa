# VPC Management and Basic Operations

VPC management offers the following operations. These are basic VPC management actions and don't have any impact on the actual network configurations.

## Powering ON/OFF the Virtual Router

Switching the VPC power state is possible using the **power status** button on top. This is usually <span class="green">**green**</span> if the VPC is powered ON, and <span style={{ color: 'grey' }}>greyed</span> out if powered OFF.

To restart the VPC, navigate to the  **Operations** tab and click the **RESTART VIRTUAL ROUTER** option. This performs quick reboot and no data is lost.
