Alerts get triggered whenever a configured condition is met. You can create multiple alerts on an instance. Alerts are sent to recipients that you can define and manage.

You can configure alerts for instances running on the Apiculus. You can define alerts for Instances and configure the email recipients for these alerts using a straightforward and easy-to-use interface.
