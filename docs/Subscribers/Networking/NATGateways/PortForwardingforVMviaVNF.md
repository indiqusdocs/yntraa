# Port Forwarding for VM via VNF

This section outlines the steps to configure port forwarding for a Virtual Machine (VM) using a Virtual Network Function (VNF) in a cloud environment. Port forwarding allows external clients to securely access services (for example SSH, HTTP) hosted on the VM by mapping ports from the VNF’s public IP to the VM’s private IP. This approach improves network segmentation and control by routing all incoming traffic through the VNF layer.

The following are the high-level tasks required to configure port forwarding for a VM via a VNF:

## Verifying SSH Access Using Public IP

Once the port forwarding rule has been successfully created in pfsense, the next step is to verify that external SSH access to the internal virtual machine (VM) is functioning as expected. This involves using an SSH client, such as PuTTY, to connect to the VM via the firewall’s public IP address and the forwarded port. If the configuration is correct, the connection is established and the VM’s shell access becomes available remotely.

The following steps guide you through initiating an SSH session using the public IP to confirm that the port forwarding rule is working correctly and external connectivity to the internal VM is operational:

1. Open **PuTTY** or any **SSH** client on your local machine.
2. Enter the **Public IP** of the pfsense WAN interface and **port 22** in **PuTTY**.
3. On the first connection attempt, a security alert window pops up showing the host key is not cached.
4. Click **Accept** to store the key and proceed with the connection.
