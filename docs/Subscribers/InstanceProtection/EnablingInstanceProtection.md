# Enabling Instance Protection

The Instance Protection service can be enabled in two ways:

1. Enable the Protect this Instance switch. There, you will get a Standard Protection Service, and you can also opt for Advance Protection Features.

## After Instance Creation

If you already have a Linux or Windows Instance and didn't enable the protection service while creating the instance, you can activate it later. Navigate to the Listing of the **Linux/Windows** Instances. Click the **particular instance**. 

To enable the protection plan service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the instance listing, select the **Protection** section and click the **ENABLE PROTECTION** button.
