# Configuring Alerts 

Alerts get triggered whenever a configured condition is met. You can create multiple alerts on an instance. Alerts are sent to recipients that you can define and manage.

You can configure alerts for instances running on the Yntraa Cloud. You can define alerts for Instances and configure the email recipients for these alerts using a straightforward and easy-to-use interface.

To view the configured alerts or configure new ones, navigate to [RHEL Instance](AboutRHELInstances.md) and access the **Alerts** tab.
## Instance Alerts

The Alerts tab lists all the alerts already configured for that particular RHEL Instance. In addition, it will show the details:
- Alert Name
- Parameter
- Trigger
- Value
- Reading Duration
