# Connecting to a RHEL Instance

Connecting to a RHEL instance allows you to securely access and manage your virtual machine remotely. You can connect using either a password or an SSH key pair. SSH key-based authentication is recommended as it provides a more secure way to access your instance.

This section comprises of the following sub-sections:

- [Connecting from a macOS or Linux Machine](#connecting-from-a-macos-or-linux-machine)
</div>

## Connecting from a Windows Machine

You can connect to your RHEL instance from a Windows machine using an SSH client such as PuTTY. This allows you to securely access and manage your instance for administration and configuration tasks.

To connect a RHEL instance from a Windows machine, follow these steps: 

1. [Download and install PuTTy.](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
2. Launch PuTTy on your computer.
3. Enter your Instance’s IP address in the Hostname field. 
4. Navigate to **Connection > SSH** > **Auth**.
5. Click the **Browse** button and select the private key file you previously generated.
6. Click **Open** at the bottom of the screen to open a connection to the Instance. PuttY prompts you to allow the connection to the host.
7. Click **OK** to confirm and the terminal window will be displayed.
8. Enter the default root user name (**root**) and press **Enter** to authenticate against the server with your SSH key.

You are now connected to your Instance.

## Connecting from a macOS or Linux Machine

You can connect to your RHEL instance from a macOS or Linux machine using the built-in SSH client. This allows you to securely access and manage your instance for administration and configuration tasks.

To connect a RHEL instance from a macOS or linux machine, follow these steps: 

1. Open any terminal program.
2. Enter the following command into the terminal. 
	```
	ssh -i ~/.ssh/<your_private_key> <username>@<your_instance_ip>
	```

    :::important
    Make sure you replace `your_private_key` with the filename of your private key; `your_instance_ip` with the IP address of your Instance; and `username` with the default root user name (**root**).
    :::

3. When prompted, allow connection to the host by typing **Yes**, then press **Enter**.
	```
	The authenticity of host 'myhost.ext (212.47.206.34)' can't be established.  
	RSA key fingerprint is 4f:ba:65:cf:14:64:a7:1e:b6:07:7c:00:71:95:21:fa.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
	
	You are now connected to your Instance.
	```
