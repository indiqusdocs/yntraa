# Managing IP Addresses

Each virtual gateway comes with a default IPv4 address that belongs to the Virtual Gateway governing the network. The default (source - NAT) IPv4 address can be used to access the Virtual Gateway publicly or via Remote Access (RA) VPN.

## Adding Public IPv4 Addresses

A public IPv4 address uniquely identifies a resource on the internet and enables communication with external networks. Add a public IPv4 address to a NAT Gateway to allow private instances to access the internet and external services while keeping them protected from direct inbound internet traffic.

To add a public IPv4 address, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Network and Security > NAT Gateways**. The following screen appears:
![List of NAT Gateways](imgnew/listofnatgateways.png)
2. Click a NAT Gateway name from the list. The following screen appears: 
![Nat Gateway Details Screen](imgnew/natgatewaydetailsscreen.png)
3. Click **IP Addresses**. The following screen appears:
![IP Addresses Tab](imgnew/ipaddressestab.png) 
4. Click the **Add Public IPv4 Address** button. The following screen appears:
![confirmpurchaseipv4](imgnew/confirmpurchaseipv4.png)
5. Select the **Monthly** option and click the **Confirm Purchase** button. The following screen appears:
![confirmipv4](imgnew/confirmipv4.png)
6. Click the **Confirm** button. 
   
The public IPv4 address is added where you can perform the following actions:

- [Deleting an IP Address](#deleting-an-ip-address) 
</div>

   
## Adding Firewall Rules

A firewall rule defines how a NAT Gateway allows or blocks network traffic based on specified criteria, such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Adding firewall rules helps control network access, enhance security, and ensure that only authorized traffic passes through the NAT Gateway.

To add a firewall rule, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Network and Security > NAT Gateways**. The following screen appears:
   ![List of NAT Gateways](imgnew/listofnatgateways.png)
2. Click a NAT Gateway name from the list. The following screen appears: 
   ![Nat Gateway Details Screen](imgnew/natgatewaydetailsscreen.png)
3. Click **IP Addresses**. The following screen appears:
   ![IP Addresses Tab](imgnew/ipaddressestab.png) 
4. Click the **Add Public IPv4 Address** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Confirm Purchase IPv4](imgnew/confirmpurchaseipv4.png)
5. Select the **Monthly** option and click the **Confirm Purchase** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Confirm IPv4](imgnew/confirmipv4.png)
6. Click the **Confirm** button. The following screen appears: 
   ![Firewall Rule](imgnew/firewallrulenew.png)
7. Click the **Firewall Rule** icon (highlighted in red). The following screen appears where you provide the required details:
   ![Firewall Rule Creation](imgnew/frcreation.png)
8. Click the **Add Rule** button. The firewall rule is added.

## Adding Port Forwarding Rules

A port forwarding rule maps incoming traffic on a specific public IP address and port to a private instance and port within your virtual network. Adding port forwarding rules enables external users or services to securely access applications running on private instances through the NAT Gateway.

To add a port forwarding rule, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Network and Security > NAT Gateways**. The following screen appears:
   ![List of NAT Gateways](imgnew/listofnatgateways.png)
2. Click a NAT Gateway name from the list. The following screen appears: 
   ![Nat Gateway Details Screen](imgnew/natgatewaydetailsscreen.png)
3. Click **IP Addresses**. The following screen appears:
   ![IP Addresses Tab](imgnew/ipaddressestab.png) 
4. Click the **Add Public IPv4 Address** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Confirm Purchase IPv4](imgnew/confirmpurchaseipv4.png)
5. Select the **Monthly** option and click the **Confirm Purchase** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Confirm IPv4](imgnew/confirmipv4.png)
6. Click the **Confirm** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Port Forwarding Rule](imgnew/pfrulenew.png)
7. Click the **Port Forwarding Rule** icon (highlighted in red). The following screen appears: 
   ![Port Forwarding Rule](imgnew/pfrulenewadd.png)
8. Click **+ Add Rule**. The following screen appears where you provide the required details:
   ![PF Rule Details](imgnew/natpfrulenew.png)
9. Click the **Add Port Forwarding Rule** button. The port forwarding rule is added.

## Changing the Source NAT 

A Source NAT (SNAT) IPv4 address is the public IP address that the NAT Gateway uses for outbound traffic from private instances. Changing the Source NAT IPv4 address allows you to route outbound traffic through a different public IP, helping you meet network, security, or connectivity requirements.

:::warning
Changing the Source NAT IPv4 address of a network interrupts connectivity for instances that use NICs attached to that network. Plan this change carefully to minimize service disruption.
:::

To change the source NAT, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Network and Security > NAT Gateways**. The following screen appears:
   ![List of NAT Gateways](imgnew/listofnatgateways.png)
2. Click a NAT Gateway name from the list. The following screen appears: 
   ![Nat Gateway Details Screen](imgnew/natgatewaydetailsscreen.png)
3. Click **IP Addresses**. The following screen appears:
   ![IP Addresses Tab](imgnew/ipaddressestab.png) 
4. Click the **Add Public IPv4 Address** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Confirm Purchase IPv4](imgnew/confirmpurchaseipv4.png)
5. Select the **Monthly** option and click the **Confirm Purchase** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Confirm IPv4](imgnew/confirmipv4.png)
6. Click the **Confirm** button. The following screen appears:
   ![Source NAT Change](imgnew/sourcenatchange.png)
7. Click the **Source NAT** icon (highlighted in red). The following screen appears:
   ![warning](imgnew/warning.png)
8. Click the **Okay** button.

## Adding a Static NAT

Static NAT maps a dedicated public IP address to a private instance within your virtual network using a one-to-one association. Adding a Static NAT rule enables external users or services to securely access the private instance by assigning it a persistent public IP address while maintaining network isolation.

To add a static NAT, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to **Network and Security > NAT Gateways**. The following screen appears:
   ![List of NAT Gateways](imgnew/listofnatgateways.png)
2. Click a NAT Gateway name from the list. The following screen appears: 
   ![Nat Gateway Details Screen](imgnew/natgatewaydetailsscreen.png)
