# Managing NAT Gateway Operations

NAT Gateway operations allow you to manage the lifecycle and availability of a NAT Gateway within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). These operations include restarting the NAT Gateway to restore or refresh its service availability and deleting the NAT Gateway when it is no longer required. Before deletion, ensure that all associated configurations, such as firewall associations and IP address assignments, are removed.
