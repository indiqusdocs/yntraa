# Role-based Access on Admin Console

Apiculus Admin Console offers role-based access control (RBAC) for all admin users. The system ships with default roles, with rights and privileges as outlined in this article.

## Admin Roles

The Apiculus system ships with the following default admin roles:

- Admin
- Accounts & Orders (AOM)
- Product
- Marketing
- Service
- Finance
- User (read-only)

:::note
To create new roles or modify any existing ones, a ticket may be raised to Apiculus (By Yotta) Support. The ability to manage roles on the Admin Console UI is currently under development.
